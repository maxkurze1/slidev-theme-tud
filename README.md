If you really want to do it the hard way and wire things up manually
then the following will try to give you some hints at least.

You can install this theme into an existing repository using

```bash
$ pnpm install git+ssh://git@github.com:maxkurze1/slidev-theme-TUD-new.git
```

Then you should be able to use it by setting the `theme` in your frontmatter:

```md

theme: TUD-new

Slidev automatically appends the `slidev-theme-` prefix to find the correct package.
(as described [here](https://sli.dev/guide/theme-addon#use-theme)).
